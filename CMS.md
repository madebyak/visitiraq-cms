# Visit Iraq CMS Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Visit Iraq Admin CMS, a completely independent web application WEBSITE that will manage content for the Visit Iraq mobile app. The CMS will be built with modern web technologies and will connect to the same Firebase backend as the mobile app.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Shadcn UI** - For pre-built UI components with a consistent dark theme
- **Lucide Icons** - For modern, consistent iconography
- **React Router** - For navigation and routing
- **React Query** - For data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Formik & Yup** - For form handling and validation
- **Recharts** - For data visualization and charts

#### Backend
- **Firebase Firestore** - Main database (shared with mobile app)
- **Firebase Authentication** - For admin authentication
- **Firebase Storage** - For image and media storage
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** - For server-side operations

#### Development Tools
- **Vite** - For fast development and building
- **ESLint & Prettier** - For code quality and formatting
- **Husky & lint-staged** - For pre-commit hooks
- **Jest & React Testing Library** - For testing
